=======
Here is a version of the AssaultCube Reloaded (http://acr.victorz.ca) game server compiled for ARM boards.
It isn't usable without the game or server package.
For licence see there. 

Current Version: 2.6 compiled with Debian 7 armhf on an Allwinner A20 SoC, so I suppose you need an ARMv7 with FPU to run this.
